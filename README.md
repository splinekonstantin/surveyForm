# Survey Form
@freecodecamp Survey Form Responsive Web Design Project

Uses: **HTML5, CSS**.

In this project I practiced working with HTML5 `<form>` element and it's validations.
Also had a trouble styling a dropdown `<select>` element as it appears differently in Google Chrome Mac and in Google Chrome PC.
Solved this by using `-webkit-appearance: none;` and adding a .png icon to emphasise that it's a dropdown.
